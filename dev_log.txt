March 18th 2024 - Beginning of dev log.
This log is being started as a result of returning to this project after 5 months and needing to reassess.
Simple Battleship project is a TDD project.
Object oriented program using factory functions to create the game boards and ships.

Game board factories are partially written.
Ship factory is partially written.
no other factories written.
Player factory is a possible consideration. 
Starting from scratch with proper planning should be in consideration.

New plan:

-Player Factory for single player, multiplayer and player vs computer.
-Computer factory that extends player with logic for playing the game automatically 
-Board factory contains logic related to the play area, placement and locations of ships on the game board 
-ship factory contains logic related to ship health, taking hits and other characteristics.
-Game Factory for initiating other factories and running the game logic.
